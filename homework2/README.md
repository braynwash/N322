# Homework One

This is the second homework assignment for N322 that serves as an introduction to User Authentication through Clerk.

# Purpose

This project aims to showcase how user authentication works in React Native Expo through the Clerk program. The project allows users to sign up and verify their email with an email code, sign in with a previously created account, and sign out from the profile page. The bulk of the content is limited and requires users to log in with an account first.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a simple, responsive mobile page with basic page elements,
- included navigation tabs with icons that take users to seperate pages,
- included sign in, sign up, email verification and sign out functionality,
- limited the visible tabs/page content to signed in users only,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.

# Set up

After downloading the assignment, you can run the project by...

- type and run `npm install` in the terminal to download remaining dev dependencies,
- run the `web` command from NPM Scripts (Visual Studio Code) to generate a live server,
- launch any Android device from the Android Studio Device Manager with Expo installed, and
- type and run `a` to generate a live server on the device.
